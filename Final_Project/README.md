# Final Project: Kubernetes Guestbook Application

## Description

In this final project, I built and deployed a simple Guestbook application using Docker and Kubernetes. The application consists of a web front end where you can enter any text and submit it. I created Kubernetes Deployments and Pods for the application, applied Horizontal Pod Scaling, and performed Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.

## Objectives

1. Build and deploy a Guestbook application using Docker and Kubernetes.
2. Autoscale the Guestbook application using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
3. Perform Rolling Updates and Rollbacks on the Guestbook application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Kubernetes configured
- kubectl configured to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster
- Access to IBM Cloud Container Registry
